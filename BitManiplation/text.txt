//to find binary numbers
//The Two's Complement method is used to represent negative numbers in binary and is defined by a simple two-step process:

−n= (Invert all bits of n) +1

Step 1: Invert the Bits (One's Complement)
Step 2: Add 1 to the Inverted Result

ex:1×8+1×4+0×2+1×1=13 is calculated from 00001101




1.2 Signed numbers (two’s complement)
Positive: same as unsigned.
Negative: two’s complement → invert bits + add 1.
Example:
-5 (8-bit) = 11111011
Check: Invert 00000101 → 11111010, add 1 → 11111011


👉 This explains why n & -n isolates the lowest set bit (we’ll use this later).


1.3 Bit length and size
For an n-bit integer, values range:
Unsigned: 0 → 2ⁿ - 1
Signed: -2ⁿ⁻¹ → 2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1
Example: 8-bit signed: -128 → 127


1.4 Shift operators
n << k: shifts left by k bits (multiplies by 2ᵏ).
n >> k: shifts right by k bits (integer division by 2ᵏ).
⚠️ Signed right shift depends on language:
In C++/Java: keeps sign bit (>> = arithmetic shift).
Python: only has arithmetic shift (preserves sign).

The Role of Two's Complement
The entire explanation hinges on how a negative number, like −n, is mathematically defined in binary using two's complement:
−n=(Invert all bits of n)+1




You are asking for a clear explanation of why the bitwise operation n & (−n) results in a value that isolates the lowest (rightmost) set bit of the number n, using the concept of Two's Complement representation for negative numbers.

/////////// SHIFT OPERATOR ////////////

The shift operators (<< and >>) are binary operators that move all the bits of a number to the left or right by a specified number of positions. They are fundamental to low-level programming and are much faster than standard multiplication or division when working with powers of two.




The shift operators (<< and >>) are binary operators that move all the bits of a number to the left or right by a specified number of positions. They are fundamental to low-level programming and are much faster than standard multiplication or division when working with powers of two.

1. Left Shift Operator (n≪k)
The left shift operator moves all bits in the number n to the left by k positions.

Feature	Description
Operation	Bits shift left; zeros (0's) are inserted on the right side.
Effect	Equivalent to multiplying the number n by 2 
k
 .
Formula	n×2 
k
 
Lost Bits	The leftmost bits are shifted out and discarded.

///Steps
I can see how the formatting of the example made it confusing! Let's break down the Left Shift operation (n≪k) and the associated multiplication by powers of 2.

The core idea is: Shifting a bit pattern left by k places is the same as multiplying its value by 2 
k
 .

1. Initial State: n=5
In 8-bit binary, n=5 is represented as 00000101.

To confirm this value, we use the place values (powers of 2) from right to left:

What range can a 16-bit signed integer store?


1. The Total Number of Possible Values (2 n)
For an n-bit integer, each of the n bit positions can hold one of two values (0 or 1).

Total Combinations: The total number of unique binary patterns (combinations) that can be represented is 2×2×⋯×2 (n times), which is 2 
n
 .

For an 8-bit integer (n=8), the total number of unique patterns is 2 8 =256 distinct values.

 )

For an 8-bit integer (n=8), the total number of unique patterns is 2 
8
 =256 distinct values.

2. Unsigned Integer Range (All Positive)
An unsigned integer uses all 2 
n
  unique bit patterns to represent non-negative (zero and positive) numbers.

Smallest Value (0): The smallest number is represented by all bits being 0 (e.g., 0000 0000 for 8 bits). This value is 0.

Largest Value (2 
n
 −1): The largest number is represented by all bits being 1 (e.g., 1111 1111 for 8 bits). Since there are 2 
n
  total values, and the count starts at 0, the largest value is 2 
n
 −1.

Example: 8-bit Unsigned (n=8)
Range: 0→2 
8
 −1=0→256−1=0→255.

3. Signed Integer Range (Using Two's Complement)
A signed integer uses the Most Significant Bit (MSB), the leftmost bit, to represent the sign of the number:

0 in the MSB means the number is positive or zero.

1 in the MSB means the number is negative.

The standard way to represent negative numbers is called Two's Complement. This scheme divides the total 2 
n
  patterns almost exactly in half: one half for zero/positives, and the other half for negatives.

Maximum Positive Value (2 
n−1
 −1)
Since one bit is reserved for the sign, only the remaining n−1 bits are available to represent the magnitude.

The total unique patterns for positive numbers (including zero) is 2 
n−1
 .

The largest positive value occurs when the sign bit is 0 and all other n−1 bits are 1. This maximum value is 2 
n−1
 −1.

Minimum Negative Value (−2 
n−1
 )
The negative range starts at −1 and goes down to the most negative number.

The most negative value is represented by a 1 in the MSB, followed by all n−1 zeros. This value is −2 
n−1
 .

Example: 8-bit Signed (n=8)
Here, n−1=7.

Maximum Positive Value: 2 
8−1

 −1=128−1=127.

Binary: 0111 1111 (The MSB '0' means positive).

Minimum Negative Value: −2 
8−1
 =−2 
7
 =−128.

Binary: 1000 0000 (The MSB '1' means negative).

Range: −128→127 (a total of 256 values: 127 positive, 128 negative, and 1 zero).













  
 A 16-bit signed integer can store values in the range of −32,768 to 32,767.

You can figure this out using the formulas that define the range for a signed integer based on its bit length (n).

Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Identify the Bit Length and Formula
A 16-bit integer means the bit length, n, is 16.

For a signed integer using the standard Two's Complement representation, the formulas are:

Minimum (Most Negative) Value: −2 
n−1
 

Maximum (Most Positive) Value: 2 
n−1
 −1

2. Calculate the Exponent
Since n=16, the exponent used in the formula is n−1:

n−1=16−1=15
3. Calculate 2 
15
 
First, we need to find the value of 2 
15
 :

2 
15
 =32,768
This number, 32,768, represents exactly half of all the total possible unique values (2 
16
 =65,536).

4. Determine the Range
Now, substitute 2 
15
  into the range formulas:

Minimum Value (Most Negative):

−2 
n−1
 =−2 
15
 =−32,768
Why this value? In binary, the pattern 1000 0000 0000 0000 (where the leftmost '1' is the sign bit) represents the largest negative magnitude.

Maximum Value (Most Positive):

2 
n−1
 −1=32,768−1=32,767
Why this value? In binary, the pattern 0111 1111 1111 1111 (where the leftmost '0' is the sign bit) represents the largest positive magnitude.

The final range is −32,768 to 32,767

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. How −n is Calculated (Two's Complement)
In computer systems, a negative number -n is represented using the Two's Complement of the positive number n. This calculation has two steps:

Invert the bits (One's Complement): Flip every bit of n (change 0s to 1s, and 1s to 0s). This gives you ∼n.

Add 1: Add 1 to the result of the inversion: ∼n+1=−n.

This operation has a crucial side effect that is key to the trick:

The operation ∼n+1 flips all bits ∗up to and including the rightmost ’1’ in n∗.
2. Tracing the Bits (The Key Insight)
Let's use an example, n=40 (in 8-bit binary) to see where the magic happens:

Step	Value	Binary Representation	Observation
n (Original)	40	…0010100	The lowest set bit is in the 2 
3
  position.
1. Invert (∼n)	-41	…1101011	All bits are flipped.
2. Add 1 (∼n+1)	−n=−40	…1101100	This changes all the trailing 1s (from the invert step) back to 0s, up to the location of the original lowest set bit.

Export to Sheets
Notice what happens at the location of the original lowest set bit (the 2 
3
  position, marked in bold):

In n, the bit is 1.

In -n, the bit is 1.

All bits to the right of the lowest set bit are 0 in both n and −n.

3. The Bitwise AND (&) Operation
The final step is the Bitwise AND (&) between n and −n.

The AND operation returns a 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

0010000
​
  
(Original 40)
(Two’s Complement of 40)
(Decimal 8)
​
 
Let's look at the result:

Bits to the left of the lowest set bit: One number has a 0 and the other has a 1 (or both are 0), so the AND result is 0.

Bits to the right of the lowest set bit: Both numbers have a 0, so the AND result is 0.

At the location of the lowest set bit: Both n and −n have a 1, so the AND result is 1.

The final result, 0010000 (which is 8), is a number that has only the 2 
3
  bit set, which was the original lowest set bit of n=40.

Summary
The expression n&−n isolates the lowest set bit because:

n has a '1' at the lowest set bit position and '0's to the right.

−n is constructed in a way that it also has a '1' only at that same lowest set bit position, and '0's to the right.

When you AND them together, the '1' at that specific position is the only bit that aligns with a '1' in both numbers, making it the only bit that survives the operation.
